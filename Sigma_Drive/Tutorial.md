- The Score is displayed in the middle to the right of the durability. The score can be obtained for distance and dangerous driving, e.g. close overtaking or destroying an object.
- To the right of the Score is the Score Multiplier. It can be increased if you drive above 70kmh, by driving dangerously, driving fast and driving on the wrong side of the road

### c. Tips
- Remember, be sigma
- The faster you go, the higher your score multiplier
- If you drive below 70kmh your multiplier resets
- The multiplier increases x2 when you drive on the wrong side of the street
- Score and Multiplier Can also be increased by close overtaking, scratching and destroying cars, destroying obstacles and driving through crossings, red lights and holes in the road
- While driving you can collect upgrades: (multiplier increase, speed increase, repair)
- You can drive onto the sidewalk and drive backwards (no, you can't fall under the map by reversing, don't try)
- Don't destroy your car (optional)
- all game data is saved in gameData.json, you can change it at your own risk
