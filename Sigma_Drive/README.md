# Sigma Drive

Sigma Drive is a game created for the "invent your game 2024" competition, inspired by the "ryan gosling drive meme". It is an endless first person driving game in which you drive a car on a straight road. The goal in the game is to be a sigma, get a score for dangerous driving, and earn money and upgrade your car. Good luck on the road.

For a full tutorial check the in game tutorial or the Tutorial.md file, meanwhile some tips:

- Remember, be sigma
- The faster you go, the higher your score multiplier
- If you drive below 70kmh your multiplier resets
- The multiplier increases x2 when you drive on the wrong side of the street
- Score and Multiplier Can also be increased by close overtaking, scratching and destroying cars, destroying obstacles and driving through crossings, red lights and holes in the road
- While driving you can collect upgrades: (multiplier increase, speed increase, repair)
- You can drive onto the sidewalk and drive backwards (no, you can't fall under the map by reversing, don't try)
- Don't destroy your car (optional)
- all game data is saved in gameData.json, you can change it at your own risk
- Click the rear view mirror to enable Sigma Mode, or enable it from settings
