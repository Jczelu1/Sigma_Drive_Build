# Sigma Drive

Sigma Drive is a game created for the "invent your game 2024" competition, inspired by the "ryan gosling drive meme". It is an endless first person driving game in which you drive a car on a straight road. The goal in the game is to be a sigma, get a score for dangerous driving, and earn money and upgrade your car. Good luck on the road.
